# Dependencies

## Python requirements

You need a version of Python 2.7.X. On David's machine, the code works under Python 2.7.15. Check your Python version by opening a terminal and typing `python --version`.

We recommend setting up a virtual environment for this project. To learn more about how to set up a virtual environment, refer to the following [link](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/how-to-use-python-virtualenv/)

This folder contains a file named `python_requirements.txt`. It outlines all python packages required to run any piece of Python code in this repo. To install these packages, activate your virtual environment with `source <path-to-virtualenv>/bin/actiave` and then perform a `pip install -r python_requirements.txt`. That's all!
